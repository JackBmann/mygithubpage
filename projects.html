              <p>A simple web app that allows the user to upload two photos, give each of them a name, and then animate the "evolution" of the first photo into
                second, in the same manner as the first generation Pokémon games.  The website allows the user to download their animation for safe keeping or sharing.
                The plan was to add animations in the style of later games and to implement advertising, but neither was completed.
              </p>
              <p>The webapp used HTML and CSS for the web interface, javascript to animate the evolution, and Node.js to handle the file uploading and downloading.</p>

              <p>A multi-player investment game in which the stock prices of three tech giants (Google, Microsoft, and Facebook) are controlled by the positive and
                negative tweets each company receives. For each positive tweet the price of the stock rises, and for each negative tweet, it falls. The stock prices
                are controlled traditionally by supply and demand too, so the more people buy stock of one company, the higher that company's stock price rises.
              </p>
              <p>The webapp used python to scrape and analyze tweets, javascript to control the game, and HTML and CSS for the web user interface.</p>
              <p>A friend, two colleagues, and I built StockTalk in less than 24 hours at HackRice 2016. I worked primarily with the front end web interface and did
                a lot of research on how each part of the project would fit together.

              <p>I traveled to Delaware one weekend in October of 2015 to participate in a hackathon for charity.  Chase sponsored students to build a piece of software
                for a local charity, in this case either Goodwill or The Children's Aid Society.  My team of four other students chose to build a webapp for The Children's
                Aid Society.  I primarily worked on the front end of the webapp, mostly the web design using Bootstrap.

              <p>HOUAlert is a system that conglomerates all current emergency, weather, and public works data into a seamless and easy to use interface. Using the ESRI
                mapping system, we layered 311, police, fire, weather, and hurricane data, resulting in one map that accomplishes what previously took four.
              </p>
              <p>Both the webapp and the Android app used ESRI ArcGIS to map the relevant data.  We acquired the data, such as active 311 reports and HPD or HFD incidents,
                through HTML scrapers and city databases.  The webapp was built with HTML, CSS, and javascript.
              </p>
              <p>Inspired to help after a gigantic storm and lots of flooding in our area, a few friends and I, a Houston city services worker, and a couple other
                people we met along the way built HOUAlert as a way of keeping track of disasters and emergencies in Houston.  We built HOUAlert in less than 24 hours
                at the Houston Hackathon, a civic hackathon where every team uses the city's data resources to build something to benefit the city and its citizens.
                I primarily worked on the Android app and the integration of the ESRI GIS system.
              </p>
              <p>HOUAlert won the prize for the "Best use of ESRI technology".</p>

              <p>Trapomino is a Tetris based game where the player takes on the role of a zoo keeper trying to recapture escaped animals. By rotating and placing
                tetromino blocks on a grid, the player must catch animals by creating “cages” with the shapes. The player must capture a variety of animals, each
                with different abilities that challenge the player in new ways. The player will advance through stages of increasing difficulty and new sets of
                animals until he reclaims all of the escaped animals.  Trapomino includes a story mode as well as an endless beat-the-high-score gamemode.
              </p>
              <p>Trapomino was built entirely from scratch using Java.  The music and art is all original, and I came up with the idea for Trapomino's game
                mechanics and theme one morning while brushing my teeth.
              </p>
              <p>Trapomino was the product of a team of four Clear Lake High School Students.  We had previously worked together on the 2014 SET competition making
                a superhero themed platformer called Project Electus, however we narrowly missed attending BPA Nationals that year.  Team Trapomino consisted of:

              <p>     -- Alexis Lopez, Graphics and Audio Lead</p>
              <p>We placed second at Business Professionals of America Nationals in the Software Engineering Team event for our work on Trapomino.</p>
